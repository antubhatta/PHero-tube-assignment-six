                <h1 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold">Q-1: Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h1>
                <p class="text-sm lg:text-lg font-medium"><span class="font-bold text-xl">Ans:</span> In JavaScript,
                    var, let, and
                    const are used to declare variables, and they have different scopes and behaviors:</p>
                <p class="text-lg lg:text-xl font-bold">1. var</p>
                <p class="text-sm lg:text-lg font-medium">var declarations are function-scoped, meaning they are only
                    accessible
                    within the function in which they are declared.If a var variable is declared outside of any
                    function, it becomes a global variable and can be accessed from anywhere in the script.Variables
                    declared with var are hoisted, which means their declarations are moved to the top of the function
                    or global scope during the compilation phase. However, the initialization remains in its original
                    place.</p>

                <p class="text-lg lg:text-xl font-bold">2. let</p>
                <p class="text-sm lg:text-lg font-medium">let declarations are block-scoped, meaning they are only
                    accessible
                    within the block (a block is typically defined by curly braces {}) in which they are
                    declared.Variables declared with let are not hoisted in the same way as var. They are hoisted, but
                    they are not initialized until their declaration statement is executed.</p>

                <p class="text-lg lg:text-xl font-bold">3. const</p>
                <p class="text-sm lg:text-lg font-medium"> declarations are also block-scoped, like let.Variables
                    declared with
                    const must be initialized when declared, and their values cannot be reassigned after initialization.
                    However, if a const variable holds an object or array, the properties or elements of the object or
                    array can be modified.</p>

                <h1 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Q-2: Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
                <p class="text-sm lg:text-lg font-medium"><span class="font-bold text-xl">Ans:</span> The common use
                    cases for null
                    and undefined in JavaScript:</p>

                <p class="text-lg lg:text-xl font-bold">1. null</p>
                <p class="text-sm lg:text-lg font-medium"> Use null when you want to explicitly indicate the absence
                    of a value or
                    an empty object reference.It can be used to reset or clear a variable that previously held an object
                    reference.It's often used in situations where you want to represent an intentional lack of data or
                    to handle optional values.</p>

                <p class="text-lg lg:text-xl font-bold">2. undefined</p>
                <p class="text-sm lg:text-lg font-medium"> undefined typically represents a variable that has been
                    declared but
                    hasn't been assigned a value. It's automatically assigned to variables that have not been
                    initialized or function parameters that haven't received a value.You may also encounter undefined as
                    a default return value for functions that do not explicitly return anything.</p>

                <h1 class="text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold mt-6">Q-3: What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
                <p class="text-sm lg:text-lg font-medium"><span class="font-bold text-xl">Ans:</span> REST API, or
                    Representational
                    State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a set of architectural principles for designing
                    networked applications. It is an approach to building web services that use the HTTP protocol to
                    enable communication between different systems or software components.<br><br> REST APIs are based
                    on a few key principles, including the use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for
                    performing actions on resources, a stateless client-server communication model, and the
                    representation of resources as URLs. Data is typically exchanged in common formats like JSON or
                    XML.<br><br> REST APIs are widely used in web development because of their simplicity, scalability,
                    and ease of use. They facilitate interoperability between different systems and allow for the
                    creation of web services that can be accessed by a variety of clients, including web browsers,
                    mobile apps, and other software applications.</p>
